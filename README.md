# TRAFFIC_SIGNAL
Traffic signal project in Visual Basic to control the 4-way traffic in cities automatically.

In this project :

*I have used 4 picture boxes and each picture box is used as a frame for each of the 4-directions.

*Inside each picture box I have used 3 shape control to visualize the three traffic light(Red, Yellow, Green) signal.

*To automate the working of traffic signal, I have used a timer control.

*The timer control is coded in such a way that on every 15 seconds it will change the traffic signal for all the 4-directions.

*To display the time I have used label on all the 4 picture boxes for all the 4-directions.
